    <p><b>Idukki</b> is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.
        It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. 
        Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976.
         Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala.Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala.
         The urban population is higher than the rural population. Idukki is rich in forests and thus is also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".
         This beautiful High range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki is always associated with Power Generation. 
         About 66% of the State’s Power needs come from the Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki.
         Kattappana is the main urban centre in the high ranges of Idukki district. Idukki Dam, Asia's largest arch dam, is located in the Idukki Township. The dam is located at the point where the Periyar flows through the gorge formed between two high and massive rocks known as 'Kuravan' and 'Kurathi'.The Idukki Hydroelectric Project caters to more than 60% of the power requirements of the state of Kerala.
