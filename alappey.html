    <p><b>Alappuzha</b> is the smallest district in Kerala.It was formed as Alleppey District on 17 August 1957. The name of the district was officially changed to Alappuzha in 1990.
        Alleppey town was renamed Alappuzha in 2012, even though the anglicised name is still commonly used to describe the town as well as the district. The district is best known for its picturesque backwaters.
        Alappuzha is well connected by waterways to various other parts of Kerala, including the tourist destination of Kumarakom; and the district is itself a well known tourist destination. 
        The district is known for its Coir factories, as most of Kerala's coir industries are situated in and around Alappuzha.
        The district is home to the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising against the British and also the revolt against the Feudal raj.
        This district had a prominent role in the freedom struggle of the country. The campaign for the eradication of untouchability was organized much earlier in this district by T.K. Madhavan, a fearless journalist and in 1925 the approach roads to the temples, especially to Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Swami temple were thrown open to the Hindus of all castes. The district also witnessed the ‘Nivarthana’ movement which was started as a protest against the constitutional repression of 1932. The first political strike in Kerala was held at Alappuzha in 1938.
